Jomsocial-Photos-Module-Extended
================================

A Patch to Allow Jomsocial Photos Module Extended to utilized S3

Replace the Helper.php (at modules/mod_jomsocial_photos_extended/helper.php) from the Original Installation with this one so that it can detect when a photo is on S3 and reroute the link accordingly.
